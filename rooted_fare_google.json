              "text": "I’ve had their “Tommy Salame” before. It was adequately sized and normally priced for the quality you’re getting. This time I got the “Chicken Parm Sando.” I would say it was truly overpriced for the quantity you are getting. $21 for a small 6 inch sub makes no sense even if all the ingredients maybe organic or better quality. I would have priced that at $16 maximum because I know their overhead costs may be on the higher end. I just was expecting a bigger and more filling sandwich for that hefty price tag. Overall, it tasted great and homemade which I appreciate. However, it was a bit too acidic per my preference leaving me with some heartburn. I also got the $4 “Rye Brownie.” It had a more dark chocolate flavor and the texture was more wet like fudge rather than pillowy softness. I also experienced some heartburn from that. I wanted to purchase a tiny box of a single serving chocolate covered honeycomb but it was priced at $20. I mean online the “Honeymoon” brand sells it $12.50 each. I just found everything on their shelves from chocolates to jams priced double or triple what you would pay for elsewhere all to appease their rent and salaries. I really like their dedication to quality and freshness. And it’s truly an aesthetically pleasing atmosphere. They just need to work on adequately pricing their food and products according to the market.",

              "text": "We had a wonderful brunch experience at Agnes! The cheese board was definitely the highlight, offering a great selection of cheeses with enough variety to keep things interesting and never repetitive. It felt like the perfect way to start the meal. Since it was brunch, we also ordered toast and salad. The crème brûlée toast stood out it was sweet, indulgent, and quite filling, almost like having dessert for breakfast. On the lighter side, the Babé Farms Lettuces salad was beautifully done, with fresh mixed greens paired with Aries cheese, smoked almonds, and dates, all tied together with a mustard shallot vinaigrette. The combination of crunchy nuts and sweet dates made it both refreshing and satisfying.\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is another big plus. With exposed brick walls, high ceilings, and a spacious patio, it feels open and stylish, yet still comfortable and welcoming. The way the dining room, bar, and market space flow together makes it feel unique and versatile. I also appreciated how extensive the menu is there are options for breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner, which makes it a place you could easily visit again and again for different occasions. On top of that, the drink selection is varied enough to complement any meal. Overall, Agnes is a spot that delivers not only on flavor but also on ambiance and versatility.",

We got seated about 10 minutes after our reservation time which was expected. A server offered to take our drink order within a few minutes. Then another one went up to our table for the same purpose only a few minutes after the original order. With one vegetarian in the group, we attempted to order a mix of entrees that offered something for everyone. The Cheese Board was too small for four hungry women who had just gotten massages. The Crispy Tater Tots tasted just like any other, minus the crispy. The Beets and Pears was meh. The Grilled Cauliflower wasn't available but they made it with broccolini and that was okay. Unfortunately, there weren't any distinguishing seasonings or flavors that stood out. The carnivores ordered the fried chicken and skirt steak. They said it was good. We each one cocktail which didn't wow anyone. While we asked the server for her assessment on whether she thought we had ordered enough and she said it was a lot of food. It wasn't given the family-style service and small portions. There was a long delay between each order, including our drinks. We found ourselves done in between orders as we looked toward the kitchen area hoping to see a server with one of our orders.\n\nSince we were celebrating a birthday, we asked to see the dessert menu which was very unimpressive (root beer float, some kind of bread pudding, sorbet and some chocolate taco). We assumed that they would bring some kind of dessert for the birthday girl but no such luck. She did, however, get a birthday card as soon as she sat down. I would recommend this if one wants a light meal with loud ambiance in a restaurant-deli ambiance. I will not be returning for a light meal nor a dinner as the food and service were nothing spectacular, especially for a tab of $326.72.",

We got there early and had dinner.  They had excellent vegan options and other plant forward food.\n\nOur table ordered the chicken katsu sandwich, the fried cauliflower tacos (order without kimchi sauce for a vegan option), and my dish, the boho bowl.  It all was fresh bright.   The chips that went with the sandwich were flavored with vinegar and a bit too zingy for our palate.\n\nThe boho bowl was full of flavor and variety, yummy lentils, brown rice, greens, beets, grilled broccoli, pickled onions, and a wonderful chimmichuri sauce.\n\nThe store had a very well thought out variety of items for sale, including books and boutique pantry items that are some of the newest items on the market.\n\nThere is a grab and go area near the front with food.  You can eat inside or outside.\n\nThere is even a clay studio inside.  I didn't find out about it, but it looked fun.  The surroundings were fabulous.  The sun went down right in front of us, behind the trees\n\nI would love to come back for an experience that includes more than music, even though my butt hurts, lol!!!",

I’m a big fan of anything sweet they have, but there’s such a variety of flavors just ask any of the awesome staff.",

Get there bright and early or pre-order if you're looking to get a good amount of pastries.\n\nWe went this past Saturday in hopes of our favorite, the Okonomiyaki Danish. It has a buttery layered pastry with a soft boiled egg in the middle-- heaven! But we were too late. Thankfully, they were making a fresh batch of their Black Sesame and Coconut Ube cookies. Of course we had to get a cookie! I also go for the Coconut Ube, it's not too sweet & coconut pairs so well with Ube. The cookie itself is also slightly crispy on the edges and has a lovely chewy middle.\n\nWe also grabbed a Matchamisu! It was our first time trying it and it won't be our last. The perfect amount of matcha is infused into the cream layers while the coffee soaked layers don't overpower the matcha. And, best of all, it's not too sweet!\n\nThis past visit was the first time I noticed their day-olds basket. Sadly, it was also empty, but I love businesses that offer this! Rather than toss everything at the end of the day, they package items that are slightly more shelf stable and sell them at a discounted cost.\n\nI always enjoy being greeted by the staffs chorus of \"welcome in!\" & pink cafe aesthetic, it really just sets such a great tone for my day!\n\nNext time, I'll be sure to get there early so I can finally get my hands on that danish again! (Also they're dog friendly! They have a jar of dog treats by the window for your furry friends)",

I have the Pandan milk bun, it was so good, the Pandan cream inside the bun was gooooood.  If you ever had a concha, it’s  an elevated concha with Asian flavors. I had a piece of the Yuzu meringue Bun,  the Yuzu flavor came with a punch.  Strong Yuzu flavor. I’m more of a savory person but these desserts hit the spot.  The staff were nice and welcoming.  There was a line when we got there but it went by pretty fast. There are  about 4 tables outside the store where you can enjoy these bomb.com desserts.  Would recommend coming here.  Parking is a little tough but we were able to find something.  If you looking for a spot to walk around Lake Merritt is literally a few blocks away.",

For those with lil' kids, they do provide a nice play room so you can enjoy a bit of chillin time over great cup of joe.\n\nI do love the contemporary atmosphere it features with the artsy paintings and posters around the walls.\n\nThe baristas are all very helpful in assisting you to pick your order and even accommodate customization requests.\n\nOn my initial visit, I went for their signature Vivid Cream Latte, which was their version of brown sugar latte with cream top and cocoa powder. The drink that made me fell in love with this place on first try, served just at right sweetness with great brown sugar taste that nicely didn't overpower the bold coffee flavor. The cream top also came as perfect balance to the cup, which sometimes atypical one ended up diluting the coffee.\n\nOn my other visits when I wasn't really feeling like having cream top coffee, I would go for their hot brown sugar latte introduced by the barista as I wanted brown sugar in my coffee but not the cream.

It’s the kind of spot that just feels good to be in.\n\nThe cozy vibe paired with the friendly and welcoming staff made the experience even better. Everyone was super kind and helpful, which made my visit feel extra special.\n\nI ordered the Ultralight Bean, a caramel latte with cold foam, and it was absolutely delicious. The flavor was perfectly balanced—not overly sweet, just smooth and satisfying. I was super impressed with the quality and care put into the drink.\n\nCan’t wait to come back and try more of their coffee and tea options. This place is definitely a new favorite!\n\nLet me know if you’d like a shorter or more casual version too!",

We sat in the area that is sunken under the sidewalk, with wide open windows looking on the ruins of the church. The food was outstanding. We had a lovely strawberry caprese salad and the bourbon duck liver pate plate for appetizers. I had the chef special shrimp ravioli in a lovely lemon cream sauce with heirloom tomatoes. My parents both got the bacon wrapped meatloaf. Perhaps the best highlight, though, was the service. I want to give a shout-out to our server, Clerisa. I was at the restaurant with my parents (both in their mid-80s). Clerisa (as were the rest of the attentive staff) was wonderful the entire time, but the tip of the cap goes to her graciously giving us an incredible desert (on the house). It was amazing ice cream (I'm guessing from McConnell's), topped with lovely chocolate cookie crumbs, caramel, and a mint leaf. Again, 5 stars around!",

They also have really large windows, which invites an indoor, outdoor feel. Our server, Daren, was super attentive, nice, and eligible. We ordered that liver pate, focaccia bread, and ricotta gnocchi for starters. If you love pasta and pork belly, I highly recommend the ricotta gnocchi. I could have ordered this for my main dish!\nUnfortunately, I didn't love my main dish, I ordered the bacon wrapped meatloaf, I just felt like the meatloaf was a little dry. But it came side of truffle Mac and cheese, which was perfectly flavored and not overly cheesy.  I also tried my boyfriend's rib eye which we both loved.\nWe also had a cake for my dad in the back which they brought out and lit candles, they also had their own little dessert ice cream they gave us. Overall had a great time. This place is also located in a fun area, right across the mission, and next to a few dive bars.

She told me that she just mixes it together and it makes a good consistency. What she's mixing in with the cream cheese is mold.

This store demands a premium but delivers a decidedly subpar experience, particularly when compared to other local options.\n\nThe customer service at the specialty counters is scarce and, frankly, indifferent. Finding an employee to assist is a quest, and when you do, the service is minimal. This lack of attention is baffling given the store's purported high-end positioning.\n\nMore critically, the value scales here are completely off. The prices are exorbitant across the board, and the quality of the produce is simply not good enough to justify them. When Trader Joe's down the street offers noticeably fresher produce for literally a third of the price, it’s impossible to rationalize shopping here. It feels less like a market and more like a selling overpriced goods with attitude.\n\nThe checkout process is where the dysfunction climaxes. Typically, only one human cashier is open, leading to unnecessary long waits. The self-checkout stations, which should provide some speed, are an absolute disaster. They are overly sensitive, frequently \"freaking out\" with the slightest movement, and seem to be running on outdated, unreliable software. It's a system designed to frustrate customers rather than streamline purchases.\n\nBristol Farms needs to seriously invest in its operations: either update those temperamental self-checkout stations with working, modern software, or, preferably, hire more cashiers to provide the level of service customers paying these prices deserve. As things stand, this location is simply not worth the time or the cost, much like the \"village\" of Calabasas itself.",

They also have a hot food bar with different cuisines, a bakery with mouth-watering pastries, and a sushi department with authentic and tasty sushi. I also noticed that they have a wine, beer, and spirits section, as well as a coffee, juice, and smoothie bar.

No over cooked gummy rice, and a good balance of fish with some rice, not a glob of gummy rice with some fish. Included is a packet of wasabi, soy sauce was not included, but I’m sure available at the counter.\nThe quality of the fish was very good, melt in the mouth tender.  I think if you have to bury the sushi in all that garbage, how good is the fish? I know thats the westernization of sushi … yuk.\nI learned from the cashier, the sushi chef/owner is Japanese and takes a lot of pride in his product. Well the proof is in the sushi!

While shopping, I was approached and accused of stealing shrimp — something I absolutely did not do. This accusation was made without any valid reason or evidence, and I could not help but feel I was being racially profiled. I used the self checkout to purchase chicken livers for my dogs food and some milk. I knew exactly who was attempting to purchase shrimp, it was a clean shaven white man with a polo shirt next to me.\n\nThe way the situation was handled made it even worse. The manager was dismissive, showed no real accountability, and made no effort to sincerely apologize or investigate the situation properly. Instead of addressing the harm caused, they treated me as if my feelings and dignity didn’t matter. His name is Brad. After letting Brad know I was getting profiled, he let me know that the register doesn’t see race. Well obviously I know that, but getting chased outside the store and assuming I was the one stealing, your staff see that.\n\nBeing profiled and falsely accused is humiliating and unacceptable, especially in a store that claims to value its customers. This incident has left me shaken, and I will not be returning to this location. I hope Bristol Farms takes this feedback seriously and invests in training their staff on bias awareness, customer respect, and accountability.\n\nI’m also a chef that does pop up’s and work with community organizations so I will be letting everyone know of this harmful incident.",

I've been disappointed lately with the inconsistency at all the restaurants lately. Like the nasty double chicken tostada I ate at el pollo Loco just two days ago. And not to mention the inconsistency at panda express. Sometimes is good. Sometimes is not. But this food at this Bristol farms yesterday was AMAZING!!! Best $15 I've spent in my life. The teriyaki chicken was soft and delicious. The rice, the pasta and all the other items I picked. And everything else I saw looked ridiculously delicious. So I'm going to try them next time. Thank you guys for the good food. Especially on these hard times, that things are so expensive. But at least at this place you'll know your money will be well spent. Thank you again, and keep up the good work. And the staff was nice and polite as well.",

Whether you’re looking for a unique gift, a piece of Montana-made decor, or just want to soak in the inspiring ambiance, this shop is a must-visit.\n\nTheir commitment to sustainability and small businesses is evident in every product they carry. Plus, the events they host add an extra layer of charm, making it a hub for creativity and connection.\n\nHighly recommend stopping by—this place is a true reflection of the heart and soul of Livingston!  Make sure to ask for Kristi—she’s wonderful and can help you find exactly what you are looking for.",

Even though I know I can get them at a slightly higher price a few blocks to the east lol. Best of all - with a smile.\n\nThe lines are long here often. With good reason, but there are some flaws.\n\nPrevious review: MOMENTOUS OCCASION! Alas, finally I got a genuine, warm smile here! One of the guys that work in the little room where they prepare stuff. A baker? He was dressed like one. Anyway amazing! He should train (or reprogram) everyone else here! He’s actually not bad looking.\n\nThis used to be a five star review. The bread is top notch but the service is absolutely not.\n\nPrevious review: Please reprogram the staff. Yes, reprogram because everyone else here is an automaton struggling with their interactions in the most cosmopolitan city in earth. In front they have one highly efficient staff that makes things function, an always clueless, slothlike and socially inexperienced cashier and a barista that is ponderous and expressionless.\n\nThey’re probably all imported from Montana or Nebraska. Who knows? Devoid of much human contact or far worse. Cultural tipping points anyone? Nah, please don’t let it be so!\n\nToday the cashier didn’t get the order right and renamed me. I kind of noticed something was off but didn’t find out till the barista only made one latte when I had asked for two. He asked me if the latte was mine instead of calling out a name and that’s when I saw I had a brand new name. lol. Instead of clarifying my name, which would involve more human interaction , the poor young woman went deeper into her introverted  comfort zone and wished everything would turn out fine. It didn’t though.\n\nI have a theory about this place. Their programming limits them to smile expressly for weird and entitled Larchmont entertainment industry types. They actually live around here. lol.\n\nAnnoying anecdote of the year: the cashier renamed me with the name of a horrid supervisor I had to endure for a year and a half in the world’s most toxic job environment.  Actually this was kind of funny n a masochistic and self deprecating way. lol\n\nThey took soooooooo long sorting things out, etc that a meter maid was gleefully writing a ticket for me outside lol. Ok this is my fault but I’m warning everyone that you should never ever make the mistake of thinking a visit to Clark St can ever, ever be a quick one. lol pay your meter! lol.\n\nHere is my first review:\n\nWe arrived at around 8 am and there was already a small line. We had to wait outside. There were a bunch of people sitting outside. They’ve got some pretty cool merch. They play cool enough music. Today it was Killers sounding alt pop.\n\nThere are literally a ton of pastry and bread options.\n\nSo my favorite bakery ever is in Berlin and this one comes very close but they don’t have the raspberry and white chocolate bread I had in Berlin. I mention the Berlin bakery because I haven’t run into a bakery quite like this one or Clark St in Los Angeles. Not to say we don’t have great bakeries here.\n\nI had a breakfast plate with a pastry and a latte today. I ordered the Bacon and Eggs plate which included slices of bread, two scrambled eggs, three pieces of bacon, butter and preserves. The bread was incredibly fresh and the crusts weren’t too hard. They were just right. The bacon was cooked to perfection. It was not too thin and not too thick. The eggs were great.\n\nI chose a Swedish cinnamon bun. It was amazing. I love cinnamon bread. The pastry was soft inside and had a slightly crunchy exterior. It paired well with my three shot latte which was incredibly balanced and subtle in flavor.\n\nI tried a croissant which was great but it isn’t the best croissant in Los Angeles. It’s close though.\n\nWhen we were leaving it was close to 9 am and it got pretty busy.\n\nNice clean private bathroom with a baby shelf.\n\nMeter parking in front.",

The breads are excellent, the cheese selection is small but mighty, and even the olive oil feels like it comes with a story.\n\nLove the neighborhood vibe too—it’s a place where you overhear conversations about dinner parties, food writing, and which tomato is best for your sauce.

Same goes for their pies and pâtisseries and viennoiseries. I love their rye brownie. Maybe the best brownie ever!? Everyone working there for the most part is very passionate about food and cuisine. We had a Cesar salad, a chicken paillard, which could have been a bit more generous same for the salad as we expected it to be topped with anchovies, the potatoes were delicious and fresh, same for the soup, topped with pesto.

The vibe is young and energetic, with a few tables outside the market and casual seating scattered throughout the space.\n\nWe ordered the Fatty Folds with three-cup chicken, wagyu beef pho banh mi, and beef bulgogi bowl with a fatty add-on. The Fatty Folds were an interesting twist on the Taiwanese scallion pancake, used as taco-style to wrap your choice of protein. While the concept was fun, the pancake itself was overly greasy and lacked scallion flavor. It’s a pass.\n\nThe wagyu banh mi was good overall, though a bit dry on its own. Thankfully, the pho beef dip was excellent and really made the dish better.\n\nThe bulgogi bowl came with only six tiny slices of beef on a full bowl of rice. Without the fatty add-on ($4), it would’ve been disappointing. Big thanks to the waitress who strongly recommended upgrading.\n\nService was quick, and the staff were friendly and helpful. I’d give the food 3.5 out of 5 stars, and the staff and setting 4 out of 5. Overall, it’s a 4-star place, worth checking out for the concept for once.",

Honestly the bowls were just ok at best.\n\nA person sat down next to us after ordering and their food came out and they were told the restaurant was about to close and they would need to leave. We found this odd given it wasn't even 8pm which we later learned is when they close. One by one tables were being told that they needed to leave. Then came out turn, young man who took our order came and said we needed to leave even though we were still eating and had beers half full. He told us he would give us paper cups for our beers. I'm very sure this restaurant doesn't have a license to sell draft beer to go as that doesn't exist in Los Angeles. We finished our beers in less than 5 minutes from when told to leave and during that time staff stacked all the tables and chairs around us.\n\nVery odd experience to say the least. We really wanted this to be good, but it wasn't. We eat out in the area often and will choose other places.",

              "text": "Flouring Cake Shop – A Beautiful Dessert Destination in Chinatown LA\n\nI’ve visited Flouring Cake Shop several times, and each experience has been consistently wonderful. The shop itself is charming, decorated in soft purple tones, with a clean and modern feel. Staff are always polite, welcoming, and knowledgeable about their products, which makes the experience even more enjoyable.\n\nThe cakes here are truly special. They are elegantly decorated—often adorned with edible flowers and artistic details—making them perfect for both everyday treats and special occasions. The texture is slightly lighter than many traditional American-style cakes. The buttercream is smooth, not overly sweet, and balances beautifully with the cake. While it is not an Asian-style cake (not rubbery or overly moist), when eaten at the right temperature and on the same day, it has just the right balance of softness without dryness.\n\nFlouring offers both individual sheet cake slices and full custom tiered cakes for events. Their flavors are creative and well-executed, including passion fruit, lavender lemon, black sesame, strawberry, and seasonal specials. Beyond cakes, they also serve unique desserts like Pavlova with yuzu, buttery shortbread cookies, and scones with oats—something between a traditional scone and an oatmeal cookie, deliciously balanced and not too dense or dry.\n\nThe price is big for a small piece but I have to say their cake is fancy, beautiful & delicious. It is worth it.\n\nOverall, Flouring Cake Shop is a gem in Chinatown LA. Whether you’re looking for a beautifully decorated whole cake for a celebration or simply want to enjoy a refined dessert with unique flavors, this shop is well worth a visit.\n\nStreet parking only\nThere is Metro Station Nearby",

All her baked goods pair extremely well with the coffee you can get next door and I love the shortbread cookies with the coffee. My partner and I have visited a handful of times so our tips are: get there early because they sell out, parking is usually street, grab a coffee from next door and order 3-6 cake slices and cookies to split and take home.\nIts great for couples or pairs on a lazy weekend and you can migrate over to Chinatown when your done eating to pickup some $5 pants lol",

It was hard to focus.  They had cute mugs, a variety of coffees, and so much more.\nAs soon as it was my turn to order,  Annie (owner) was super friendly and took the time to help me choose pastries to eat and coffee beans to take back home to my parents.  Annie explained how she loves doing coffee collabs and she's owned and operated this place for 10 years.  The way she explains products and talks to customers, you can just tell by the vibe that she loves what she does.\n\nI ordered:\n\n1.  Iced ceramonial matcha latte:  This was a nice comforting drink.  It wasn't overly strong, matcha, and you can taste the hint of honey.  The perfect drink while I stand in line outside for Gooey Center Cinnamon rolls.\n\n2.  Nutella croissant:  Messy delightful treat, with nutella throughout\n\n3.  Strawberries and cream:  I wasn't a fan of this one.   It was a little too tart for me.   I didn't get much sweetness from the cream.\n\n4.  Mini donut holes w/ vanilla cream filling:  This would have been tasty without the filling.  It tasted like cream cheese and kind of threw the flavor off\n\nThey had a cool colab going on with Gooey Center, cinnamon rolls, and Hap's Burgers.   You can get coffee, breakfast sandwiches, and cinnamon rolls in one place.   It's like a one-stop shop.   It's super convenient for the shopper like me.   I was able to try all 3 places while waiting for Gooey  Center to set up and open up.\n\nHighly recommend coming by and checking out.  Annie is super nice.   She made me feel welcome and even introduced me to some of her customers. She had shown me where to line up for Gooey Center and spoke of Hap's Burgers.  Hap's burger is there on Wednesday and Saturday.  Gooey Center pops up there on Saturdays sometimes.  You'll have to check the website and see where they are for the week.",

I really wanted to try pistachio croissant and they didn’t have it so I ended up getting raspberry fairy instead. It was good but not that great. Came here for pastry but I was impressed by their pork breakfast burrito. One of the best breakfast burritos I’ve had in my life! No hot sauce needed just well seasoned pork, cheese, and eggs. Pork was juicy and tender while salsa gave you a refreshing taste in one bite. Very tasty and fulfilling. My cappuccino was decent. Surprisingly, I enjoyed savory food more than their pastry here.",

Couldn't eat half of it,it was that bad, pictures doesn't do justice, the avocados were literally turned black rotting.The only thing was good was boiled egg and that's it.

My family visits often for their baked goods. Yesterday, we tried their hot bar for the first time- succotash and Japanese sweet potato. Then plus the chilled egg sandwich. 10/10. That was the best egg sandwich I’ve ever had. The bread was fluffy. The eggs were jammy. The mayo part was thick. Succotash had fresh corn and crispy cheesy edges. I didn’t feel the need to drink water after. It was well seasoned in a balanced way. The sweet potato was sooooo pretty. It was my first time having a Japanese sweet potato. The caramelized sugar elevated the potato. The small portion came with two wedges. My 68 year old mom and I shared these three items and were satisfied. This was about $25",

Crunchy and soft with the perfect amount of salt (for salt lovers). There absolutely will be quite a long line so be prepared. The indoor is decorated in a perfect western/hipster theme. Prices are fairly typical. We got the sausage egg and cheese add ago and it had a delicious aioli on it. We also did the avo boast which was great for vegetarians! Iced vanilla latte was surprisingly good but quite small for a medium. I’ll definitely be back when I’m in town!\nBe warned: there is very little seating inside, only a few tables which were completely full with their own lines by opening.",

They also have so many goodies. It was like Disneyland inside. They had ice cream, a dessert area, snacks, candies, and food options in the cases like quiches, lasagna, meatballs…\n\nThey have open seating.

The flavor was light, very light… If it was more robust flavor, I think it would have been a lot better.\n\nVegan Ube cookies & cream rice crispy treat (ube marshmallows, vegan butter, gluten free oreo pieces) $5: 3 Stars – I’m on the fence about this.  This was opposite for me with the Ube and Mango… I could taste it right away but the more I ate, the less I liked it… nothing bad about it but maybe a little artificial tasting?\n\nClassic Chocolate Chip Cookie (milk and dark chocolate and Okinawan sea salt) $5: 4 Stars – This was soooo yummy and gooey.  I loved that they used large chucks verse “chips.”  I do wish this was a little bigger for being priced at $5.  I’ve seen other bakeries that have smaller cookies but priced 2-3x more and are horrible… so I guess I shouldn’t complain? LOL\n\nYuzu-berry tiramisu (ladyfinger sponge, yuzu soak, marionberry jam, vanilla mascarpone cream) $12: 3 Stars – Very yuzy, very berry tasting LOL I do prefer the classic tiramisu over this one though… I think this is the time that classic will trump modern/contemporary 😊\n\nRESTAURANT/SERVICE:\nSmall little cute bake shop.  Due to the limit of 5 customers inside, we did not stay long as a small line started to form by the time we were done ordering.  Even with the limited amount of time spent, the workers were extremely friendly and helpful.",

The vibe here is effortlessly cool, with a cozy, artsy atmosphere that makes it the perfect spot to relax or catch up with friends. The coffee was good—I highly recommend their almond milk mocha, which was creamy and perfectly balanced.\n\nThe staff is friendly and welcoming, which adds to the overall charm of the place. I love the little touches, like the quirky artwork and the thoughtful details in their presentation. It’s clear that a lot of care goes into everything they do.\n\nIt can get pretty crowded, especially on weekends, and seating can be a bit tight. But honestly, that’s just a testament to how popular this place is! If you’re in the area, Kindness & Mischief is definitely worth a visit. It’s a great spot to enjoy quality coffee and soak in the local Highland Park vibe.",

You'll  pass by,  thinking it's a only a deli (you may be able to see the cheese display from the window).. but nooo.. they have a nice little surprise for you in the back. Stringed lights, couch seating and a nicely decorated eating patio awaits you.  For those who are in love with the charcuterie experience,  Kustaa is the place for you. Their platters are amazing and delicious. Manu, our sommelier was extremely personable and very knowledgeable. His french accent made us feel like we were in France.  His recommendation on wine was spot on! He put our wine in the coolest, little cooler bag to keep it chilled. Yon, the owner made a small oversight, but quickly made up for it with a platter of bread and dips (on the  house) The whole staff was very friendly. The woman who brought out our platter, named and thoroughly described all the meats and  cheeses that were on there. My friends ordered from the menu and enjoyed their meals. Make sure you give Kustaa a visit. Tell Manu, Gina's review brought you in.",

Flowers are blooming in this mid/late spring period, the Japanese cheese wood fragrance reminds me of home. I didn’t try the tea house, but that’s probably the best spot in the garden for enjoying Chinese tea. They have a couple of vendors in the garden, but I don’t know if they are regulars or not. They had Pacific Islanders performing today, also a cultural heritage learning session. Quite an active center for cultural sharing in the heart of town, close to both Union Station and the river bank, very central location and easily accessible by public transit.",

Great bang for your buck if you’re ballin’ on a budget but still want quality.\n\nThere’s also a big parking garage (free with validation), and it’s connected to a whole mall full of cool shops, restaurants, and dessert spots. Kinda perfect if you wanna make a little day out of it.\n\nWhether you’re hunting for rare snacks, drinks, or a quick sushi fix — this spot’s a sleeper hit. Highly recommend pulling up.",

Breakfast sandwich didn't really taste like much besides the sausage. Upon ordering, the cashier had no energy or welcoming attitude with a very monotone welcome. I don't really care about that, but I just wanted to add it because after ordering, I proceeded to ask if they can cut the sandwiches in half for us or if they're already cut. They said they're already cut in the most \"leave\" kind of voice. Then we waited a bit while walking around, hear our name called, picked up the order, and left. Whoever worked the bagging area was very nice and energetic though! When we left, I checked the food in the car and only one sandwich was cut in half, not the breakfast sandwich though. I didn't ask for much and it's so simple to answer a super easy question such as them being cut in half. I don't understand how it was miscommunicated. Although the Normandie was very good, the sauce was pretty much useless. It added no flavor to the sandwich, which is fine because it's already a good sandwich. The breakfast sandwich was very ok. The prices were very steep for what is served. The total for two sandwiches was $31 with no add-ons and the sizes were moderate with the breakfast sandwich being about the size of my palm and the Normandie being a little bigger than my hand.",

              "text": "At this restaurant, you place your order at the counter and pay in advance, so it’s a good idea to have an idea of what you’d like before stepping up to order. The interior is fairly spacious with a nice sense of openness, making it comfortable to dine in without feeling crowded. Drinks such as water are self-serve, which adds to the casual atmosphere. Compared to a full-service restaurant, it feels much more approachable and easy to visit, even for someone dining alone.\n\nThe food itself was excellent flavorful, well-prepared, and served in portions that felt just right, not overly large. Since the cuisine is Chinese, it’s perfect for sharing with friends or family, allowing everyone to enjoy a variety of dishes together. During my visit, I tried several items including the mapo tofu, boiled dumplings, mixed noodles, and fried chicken. Every dish was delicious, full of flavor, and very satisfying.\n\nThere were also several types of rice to choose from, which made the meal feel customizable to personal taste. Although I wasn’t able to try dessert this time, the options looked very tempting, and I would love to save room for one on my next visit. The pricing felt quite reasonable given the quality and variety, making it a place I could easily see myself coming back to whenever I’m craving good Chinese food.",

We came on a warm-98 degree-afternoon to quench our thirst. We were perfunctorily greeted by a tall female (with pink highlight hair) staff. I perused their menu and ordered a Burundi Cold Brew ($7.50) x 1/2 & 1/2 milk. I was desirous of having refreshing drink at this shop, and they did not disappoint. My CB was really smooth, full, and perfectly sweetened with slight hint of Mango fruit.\n\nPrices matched the quality of their coffee drinks. Service was good.

Candidly, before I booked, I wasn't sure if I wanted to pay for an appointment, so I was prioritizing spots with free appointments, but it was truly worth every penny. 1000% recommend going here!",

This was the third bridal shop that I visited and my experience was immaculate. I came in by myself this time and Delaney made me feel so comfortable from the start. She was very knowledgeable of the designers and their dresses as well as the inventory of the store. I was very impressed. She also didn't pressure me into purchasing on the spot and saying \"yes\" to the dress which made my experience ten times better. I came back a week later after taking some time to think about my decision and left with my dream wedding dress!! The whole store was so chic and the inventory wasn't overwhelming.. the vibes were on point! I will definitely recommend Lovely Bride and Delaney to all my friends, clients, and anyone looking for the best wedding dress shopping experience. ",

Be sure to ask about the size too because we didn't know they would come in a different size. The staff is really sweet and was helpful. I just wish the drinks were better, especially for the higher price point!",

The service was decent, and the overall vibe was calm and upscale.\n\nThat said, for a bill that came out to over $700 for two people (with tip), I expected a higher level of attention to detail and execution. I ordered the surf and turf ($157) with my steak medium rare, but it came out medium well. I typically don’t send things back, but at that price, I wanted it done right. To the restaurant's credit, the waiter apologized, had a new steak prepared, and removed the lobster tail from the bill. Still, it left me feeling underwhelmed.\n\nThere were other small misses, like the yucca fries my partner and I ordered to share. They came out with truffle oil on them, despite us asking for it on the side. Not a huge deal in isolation, but again, for a high-end experience, I expected more care.\n\nMaybe it’s my bias coming from the NYC area, where even mid-range restaurants often deliver a wow factor.

The view was absolutely gorgeous, skies were clear with wisps of clouds and we enjoyed seeing the sunset and the waves. Food was incredible, presented well and it was delicious. Three course meal was so good everything sounded great. We got the Crudo and Steak Tartare to start. 2nd course we got the Chicken with gnocchi and the Spotted Sea Bass. AMAZING. The desserts were so yummy...Strawberry Cheesecake and the S'mores were great. Had a couple drinks each: Sumac Sunset and Rum for the Hills and overall it was such a relaxing outing. Valet wasn't even that expensive $15, well worth it. Will be back for sure!",

I came close to closing time, we're talking about 10 minutes before. Regardless with being practically done with their day, I walk in and was delightfully greeted by \"C\" (we'll call him, bc I can't quite remember). He was very welcoming, showed me around the shop and mentioned they make lobster rolls. I said I'll take one! C explained the roll and I asked if it was possible to make it with no mayo -  I'm more of a Connecticut Style girl and their lobster rolls come Maine Style (a little mayo, celery & chives). C wasn't familiar but was so sweet to make sure he prepared exactly the way I wanted it and together we made it happen! Even though I was the last person, he didn't hang his apron-- he gave a full experience, accommodated me, and educated me about their offerings and their handroll night.  The lobster roll is actually an order for two rolls and a side of chips and came out to be $35. Everything in the shop is well curated. I'll definitely return way before closing time so I can properly shop and pick up some great items. The owners are also Filipino so bonus points as I love to support all our kababayans. Thank you!",

I also got clams and the person helped me made sure I didn’t have dead clams and gave me open bag and Ice to go (making sure the clams didn’t die during 7 min transit). The clams were delicious same as the octopus and calamari they sell. I also tried their Unagi. Although it says on their menu listing its $17/lb, the price went up to 16.95/ 8oz. Which to me is the same as 99 Ranch prices. Unagi tasted good though. What I really love at this place is their Sushi grade Salmon and Tuna. The cut in Salmon is great because its top to bottom where you get the lean and the fatty part of the salmon. It has great marbling and just melts in your mouth. Same with their Tuna. Super fresh tasting. Seaweed salad is seasoned well. Will definitely try their Oysters next time. I guess i’m just gonna go down the list and try all their seafood since its such a great price and quality.",

The hand written wine tags made me laugh and I loved seeing local makers’ and restaurants’ products on their shelves. You could really feel the love and good humor from the wine buyer and cashier.\n\nA long time ago someone told me that a good film is a film that stays on your mind and keeps you thinking about it. That applies to small businesses as well. Wine and Eggs is a damn good shop and I’m excited to go back soon, and tell my friends about it in the meantime.",

The hand written wine tags made me laugh and I loved seeing local makers’ and restaurants’ products on their shelves. You could really feel the love and good humor from the wine buyer and cashier.\n\nA long time ago someone told me that a good film is a film that stays on your mind and keeps you thinking about it. That applies to small businesses as well. Wine and Eggs is a damn good shop and I’m excited to go back soon, and tell my friends about it in the meantime.",

The pork belly boa was by for the best item of the menu we had. The pickled carrots and pickles with the savory and tender pork belly went delicious with the soft bread.

The menu is limited but everything we ordered was excellent, including the pork belly rice, beef noodles, five spice chicken wings and ice cream bao (with pandan coconut). Service was friendly and attentive, despite us not giving a tip when we paid cash at the counter when ordering (we tipped at the end of our meal). We're not used to the tipping culture, but this was definitely a meal we were more than happy to tip for. This was our last meal during our stay in LA and so glad it ended on such a satisfying note.

I recommend grabbing a menu in front while you wait in line so you know what to order when you get to the front.\n\nBrunch is great - the chicken congee and pork chop sandwich are delicious. If you’re already ordering a pork chop sandwich and a milk tea French toast, I’d skip getting an additional bolo bao from the pastry case because it’s the same bolo bao from the pork sandwich and the same oolong custard from the French toast\n\nDinner is also really good, highly recommend the noodles which have a satisfying chew to them, the chicken wings, and the pork belly bao.

The highlight though was the persimmon jam on top. The arroz caldo is (Filipino) congee, and it hit the spot, warm and soothing. For the breakfast plate, we went with (hangar) steak and eggs. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The scrambled eggs were soft and fluffy. That brick of hashed browns was crispy and light, which made us wonder if it was perhaps potatoes and jicama. It wasn't too busy when we arrived, but there was a wait when we were almost done. The service was overall good. They definitely rushed us at the end to free up the table but not to the point of being rude, so I still give them 5 stars on service.

This truly brought the review out of 3-star territory and into 4-star territory.\nAtmosphere: It's incredibly-well set up. This shop is located inside the USC Village, so the bulk of its customers are, of course, college students. If you're into Korean snacks or Korean culture in general, this should be right up your alley.",

They’re super fast with making the drinks.\n\nI think it definitely serves the average college student population who loves caffeine and sugar, but I feel like as a result a lot of the items on the menu don’t speak to me. I would likely come here over pot of cha though since the tea doesn’t feel as overbrewed and it’s also marginally cheaper.\n\nEverything inside of the store is really cute though (albeit very expensive), and it’s a great place to hang out for just a little bit.

It was drizzling and they provided umbrellas for us to use as we waited. The building is very small with maybe 10-15 people inside at one time. The service is super fast once you're inside. They have everything laid out in plain view and you just let them know what you want and they bag it up for you. They have so many options from plain croissants, filled pastries, flavored butters, fresh sourdough, and take and bake dough. They are open every other Thursday which is usually less busy but they may sell out sooner. I feel there is more variety on Saturdays. Follow their Facebook and Instagram where they post the offerings available that week. I tried the maple blonde which was so amazing! I also got an espresso supreme but my favorite was the pecan double baked croissant 😋If you love bread you HAVE TO GO HERE!",

When I came up to the bakery’s display case and saw those cinnamon rolls, I knew I had to get one. The cinnamon roll was everything I hoped for—soft, rich, and full of flavor. The cappuccino was equally delightful, perfectly crafted, and the ideal complement to the pastry.\n\nWith a large communal table at the center, it was the perfect spot to sit down, savor a cappuccino, and enjoy a delicious pastry. The staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, making the entire experience even more enjoyable.\n\nI also learned that Fariner Bakery hosts a special Apero Hour on weekends, offering cocktails, snacks, and a delightful evening experience. Overall, my visit to Fariner Bakery was a wonderful experience.\n\nI may not know if I’ll have the chance to return to Ashland, but for anyone staying at the RV campground or passing through, it’s definitely worth a stop.",

Their coffee was good and HOT (which it usually never is at independent shops). The staff was friendly, helpful, and attentive. The atmosphere is very cozy and bright. If we are in the area again and are looking for good coffee we will be stopping in. Give them a try.... you won't regret it. Parking may be a little iffy at peak times, but it's worth the effort.",

They manage to squeeze a lot of great stuff in a tiny space: pantry goods, kitchen cookbooks and accessories, body care and period products, candles, a chocolate, charcuterie and cheese cooler, fun bevvies cooler, fresh flowers, and freshly made Public Quality Bread.\n\nMy favorite product to buy here is Chilee Oil, the spicy version of their premium recipe (which used avocado oil). I like knowing that, when I buy it here, I’m supporting not just one but two great local small businesses.\n\nThe store has a well-deserved reputation of supporting the community. When Foxtrot unexpectedly closed their Chicago storefronts earlier this year and left their vendors with unpaid invoices and surplus product, Ándale invited impacted local vendors to use their patio space for pop-up markets. It was such a wholesome display of community care in a cut-throat capitalist world that can I rarely see as a consumer.\n\nThe one recommendation and opportunity for improvement I have to offer: the front entry is not wheelchair ♿️ accessible because there is a step at the threshold that is too tall to cross with most mobility aids. It would be great to see this turned into an accessible up-ramp with an automatic door.",

The flavors are incredible. The goat cheese cashew caramel is my go to and a fan favorite. The Italian Cookie tastes exactly like biscoff cookies. Serving size is perfect. Each scoop is not too big nor too small, and every bite is packed with flavor. They have amazing options for vegans too, so many dairy free options and days where they only serve dairy free! Staff are super sweet, there is lovely little outdoor patio area with string lights and tables under shady trees. My favorite spot to grab ice cream with friends (or solo!) and sit awhile. I have been eating Black Dog for the last 5 years and I can’t recommend it enough.",

Ingredients are fresh and recipes are thoughtfully and creatively prepared. I had the brisket roast beef sandwich which came on a plate with fresh sweet berries and chips. I’m going to dream about that sandwich until I can have it again. Owner Rob was incredibly kind and personable as well. We enjoyed walking around the shop and found a lot of really cool grocery items to buy like salty pistachio spread and lavender honey hazelnut butter.\n\nIt was a delightful and delectable experience all around!

You can find about 95% of everything you could need for your cooking/kitchen at this little market (fyi, it's cramped!), including fresh hot sandwiches, soups, etc., and everything is typically a unique specialty brand from elsewhere in the country, nearby or far, as well as around the world. Soap from Palestine, salt from the UK, cheeses galore from dairy farms around the world, and more. I love their French butter, local produce, Italian flours and cheeses, Grecian olive oils, and their chocolate and coffee items.\n\nThey do not have their own butcher but do sell a good basic selection (frozen) from really high quality vendors.\n\nBecause of all the imported brands or small-business farmers they purchase from, yes, prices will be higher. Focus on buying what you *want* here, not necessarily everything you *need* (although you most certainly can, of course).\n\nThey also have a great selection of local fresh breads and pastries in the mornings. I believe bread is from Baked Joint(?) and croissants are from the excellent local DC bakery/café Saku Saku Flakerie (there might be an upcharge on these, as one reviewer noted). They also have donuts (not sure where from but they're satisfying), and great local bagels.\n\nOverall, yes, expense will be a factor here. But selection has never disappointed me. I find myself always going back for specific items that I can't typically find elsewhere (and that are just too good to go back to anything different).\n\nThink of Each Peach Market as like a record store or \"greatest hits\" playlist of unique songs by smaller artists from around the country and beyond...but for groceries.",

I called ahead to learn if they have my favorite imported, fresh milk stilton and L’Amuse Gouda cheeses on hand.\n\nL'Amuse Signature Gouda is the product of a close partnership between several Gouda vendors, mainly Cono and Lutjewinkel – I like it when it’s aged 2 years or more.\n\nThe staff offers tips like “let you cheese come to room temperature a half hour before serving”. When I’m preparing for a real special event in rooms without climate control, it is worth it to serve the cheese at just the right temperature.\n\nYou can pick up Melts, Salads, Soups and Sandwiches to go. For example, I like the Curry Chicken Salad Sandwich and the Tomato Gazpacho Soup. They are well-staffed, so if there is a line, no worries - most likely you'll be checking out next.\n\nIt is also an ideal place to pick up Gifts of Taste for special friends and family.

I like how everything is cleanly displayed to allow customers to browse at their own pace without being over-stimulated. It also shows that items were carefully curated.\n\nThey have teamed up with local artists and producers to bring authentic art, food, and more to the neighborhood. I am excited to have a walkable spot for honey, nordic crackers, tinned fish, dukkah-like seasoning, and local pottery.  They also host fun workshops.\n\nAndrew is super friendly and happy to help when you have questions. I enjoyed learning about their different snacks and NA spirits. He also showed that they support their neighboring businesses by sharing information about what's opening soon.",

Had no idea that this lovely hidden gem was tucked under the Rice Asian restaurant on 14th St. in the NW section of DC. Rice in addition to the restaurant has a specialty market filled with all of the things including Sake, Asian snacks, cookbooks, sauces, teas and other items. Rice Market also hosts cooking classes and events in this space.\n\nIt was fun just exploring their curated selections to see what Rice had in store. If you want something special for a home cooked Asian meal, I suggest that you stop by Rice Market. They’re likely to have what you need. You might check out the market before or after you grab a bite at the restaurant upstairs.\n\nFor a quick snack, I opted for a Kani nigiri from the market. It was tasty & a perfect small bite while on the go.",

So grateful for the bartender's recommend or would have slept on the 'Beet Cured Salmon on Rye' which was such a delightful bite. Only complaint was not knowing what combination of things to put into each bite (spoiler alert: all of them). Will be back for the burger (another recommendation) and a dinnertime main, without question. Well done ownership and staff!",

The modern interior, with its stylish tile floor and open vibes, is very comfortable.  The food we tried was gorgeous, with the salmon toast draped in artfully sculpted watermelon radish and dill, and the quiche presented via a tall robust slice next to a mound of salad. We also tried the jiggly soufflé pancake, which was tasty, light, and fun, though a bit dry vs. the eggy-ness I expected. Big bonus points for the chai-spiced syrup though. On the downside, the egg sandwich on a \"Japanese milk bun\" was more basic than described. After many trips to Japan, I can safely say this is merely a decent standard brioche burger bun. You need to elevate a lot more to use the \"J.M.B.\" title. Onion jam is always welcome though.\n\nService was a bit forgetful and slow, though well-intentioned. We had to re-request a coffee, ask for a refill, and for salt & pepper. It's a very young staff and they could learn to be a bit more solicitous. But they are forgiven easily. Overall, the effort to compose a refined alternative to standard west Nashville brunch options is appreciated, and I'll be back to check on their progress. Next time, for the vibes and to try the sandwich menu.",

It’s not something you find everywhere, and they did it really well. I also tried the peanut butter and jelly crumb cake, which was delicious. My son absolutely loved it, and it had the perfect mix of sweetness and texture.\n\nThe two ladies working were very friendly and welcoming, which made the visit even better. The café itself has a great aesthetic, with a cozy yet modern feel that makes it a great spot to relax, catch up with friends, or even get some work done.

One of the most meaningful gestures was when they gifted me use of the back room to host my out-of-town friends and family the day before my baby shower. It meant so much — and it’s just one example of how kind and generous they are.\n\nThe staff is always attentive and welcoming. They know my wine preferences and never steer me wrong — their recommendations are always spot on! The wine selection is extensive, with something for every palate, and their events are not only top notch but also incredibly cost-friendly.\n\nTriangle Wine isn’t just a place to buy wine — it’s a place where community, connection, and quality come together. Can’t say enough great things about it!\n\nCHEERS",

Their espresso is smooth and not too acidic. As for the ambiance, I studied for several hours on the outdoor patio. It was shady where I sat and there were outlets nearby.

It seems like a bit of a modern haven seems to be nestled into a town that is frozen in time with antique stores and old-fashioned laundromats surrounding it, and the serenity that encompasses you as you walk inside to peaceful music that lulls you into a comatose before the food and coffee do highlights this even more. The seasonal iced caramel apple butter latte that I got gave me all the nostalgia in the world of a time in the yonder years of the magic of the fall time full of apple picking, pumpkin carving, and innocence galore, and the surprise mini print vending machine that they had of tiny art done by a local artist was the icing on the cake (or the whipped cream on the latte, if we're sticking to a foodie theme here). This experience wrapped up my final morning in the Catskills with a little bow, and I truly believe it would be worth a day-trip just to return here if I don't have a weekend-trip planned again any time soon. Thank you for the beautiful time! :))",

Their sandwiches are reasonably priced and incredibly tasty especially the burger and anything they have with bacon in it.\n\nI am forgiving a lot by giving them five stars but they seriously have one of the best burgers in NYC at any price point but especially for 15 bucks. The meat is super high quality, well seasoned and has tons of cheese. The size is impressive for the price too, it's a meaty smash burger that puts 7th Street to shame.\n\nNot every sandwich on the menu is a knockout, the roast beef has like no meat on it for some reason but their bacon is incredible and the breakfast sandwiches like the green eggs are solid. Love the BLT with heirloom tomatoes when it's in season.\n\nNow for the bad, the tips at the register are crazy, like 18% is the lowest tip suggestion and you get hit up for a tip for every order even charcuterie, meat, or grocery items. I gotta push back on this, it always annoys me when counter service places try to squeeze tips out of customers.\n\nTheir charcuterie is not the best and very expensive. I haven't been blown away by anything. The selection isn't great,and most things are not worth the price. Their Iberico Chorizo is solid but a lot of their charcuterie are not that interesting or curated in any way. Just a hodge podge of overpriced meats. I assume many of them are local because there would be no other reason to carry them.\n\nA lot of the stuff they carry in the store part of the business is not worth the prices they charge but as a sandwich spot they are five stars all day. Also, be warned that the sandwiches take forever to make especially on the weekends.",

I happened to walk by and noticed a sign for homemade kimchi—of course, I had to stop in and give it a try, and I’m so glad I did. You can really tell there’s a lot of care put into what they make.\n\nOn top of that, they host a wide variety of classes every month, which is such a unique touch. It’s not just a place to shop—it’s a place to connect, learn, and enjoy. I’m definitely planning to join one of their classes when I have the time.\nOverall, it’s the kind of spot that makes you feel at home right away, and I’ll absolutely be coming back.",

The location alone is a major plus.\nThe shop offers a wide variety of items, ranging from pantry goods to drinks and baked treats. However, when it comes to fresh food options—especially in the morning—the menu is a bit limited. In fact, the only breakfast meal on offer is an egg and cheese sandwich. That said, it’s a solid one—well-made, satisfying, and flavorful. It also comes with the option of a hash brown on the side, which I definitely recommend. Crispy, well-seasoned, and just the right portion. I do believe that they are priced on the bit of the higher end.\n\nThey also had a selection of baked goods on display. While I didn’t get the chance to try them, they looked fresh and genuinely tempting. As tasty as they look, I wasn’t willing to pay what I thought was an excessive price for baked goods that weren’t even coming from the bakery.\n\nOverall, Kitty’s is worth a visit, especially if you're looking for a quick, tasty bite before hopping on a train or exploring Hudson. Just don’t expect a full brunch menu—come for the quality, not the quantity.",

Homemade sauces, loved the Tahini Vinaigrette dressing. Fish and Chips crispy, waffle fries well seasoned, huge shrimp. They gave us a sample of the chocolate hazelnut ice cream and it was delicious. Thank you for the amazing experience, I will be back on Friday for the Oyster happy hour.",

Tables that ordered waaaay after us were getting their food but I ended up enjoying my food so much that I don't want to deduct the star.\n\nI had the kale caesar, add jammy egg and sweet potato, dressing on the side and my husband had the LB bowl, add chicken.

As a former NYC restaurant owner, I know how hard it is to maintain a cohesive vision that shines through the entire dining experience from first look to dessert. The building is beautiful, inside and out. The adjacent bottle shop is a charming convenience and lends a village feel to the approach. Inside the space is divided between a warm taverna style area and a soaring light, minimal industrial dinning area. Everything is tasteful and in its right place. Service was extraordinary. The entire staff moves in calm, graceful choreography attending to guests with warmth and attentiveness. Sophia, our server,  created an instant bond and made us feel like regulars and old friends as only the best of front of house staff can do. Beer list is tight and on point (don’t sleep on the Baby Kittens from Fat Orange Cat). Wine list is broad and well constructed. Cocktails list was creative and balanced with a stellar mocktail option. The menu is well put together and features the perfect meeting of new American and asian influences. Standouts were the duck bao (which after one bite, I looked at Beth and said “ooohhh! That’s MY food exactly”), the shrimp burger (slightly spicy with Vietnamese vibes) to the roasted 1/2 chicken with togarashi. Flavors were bold and inventive. Everything we ate was cooked and plated perfectly. I rarely end a meal with nothing to critique, but, well, I have nothing but superlatives here. Do note that the kitchen closes around 8:30 PM even on weekends",

I guess you'd call it a general store.\n\nThe space is very modern with nice clean lines so the products pop. The staging is on point. So much to look at.\n\nEverything is well curated. Interesting mix of items. GIN flavored ketchup and mayo?!\n\nMy friend was gushing over a dustpan he bought there. Admittedly it's a really solidly crafted one\n\nGreat for gift buying. There also have a bargain area.\n\nThis will definitely be a stop for our return visits. Love Kinderhook!",

From the outside, it looked like just another curated grocery store, but tucked in the back was a quiet little cafe. No indoor seating in the cafe, just two small tables near the entrance and a few outside.\n\nBetween the two drinks I tried—the Brown Sugar Coffee and the Iced Black Sesame Foam Hoji—the latter was my favorite. One of the employees suggested I try the Brown Sugar Coffee as a latte, but I opted for it black. In hindsight, I probably should’ve taken their advice. It ended up tasting more like a sweetened Dunkin' coffee than a refined house special.\n\nThe hoji, though, was fantastic. An ultra-creamy hojicha latte topped with black sesame milk foam. Hojicha and black sesame flavors overlapped a bit, but overall, it was a soft, nutty echo that blended well with the roasted tea notes without any graininess.\n\nIf you’re into Japanese-style café drinks with a modern twist, this one’s worth checking out.",

There are different stations to place your order and pick up depending on what you’re ordering. My friend and I ordered bubble tea. I got a cocoa oolong milk tea with pearls and she got the Chelsea drink which is strawberry milk. I thought my tea was really good, the perfect balance of tea with smooth cocoa, not too sweet (I got 25% sweetness which is the minimum level for this drink). The pearls were fresh and still warm in a lightly sweet syrup. My friend said her Chelsea drink tasted good but was really heavy (I didn’t try it). The two workers there were friendly and the turnaround time for the drinks after ordering was pretty fast.

              "text": "Nice Brunch in the countryside.\n\nGot this place recommended by a colleague and came for brunch this past weekend. We arrived a little after noon, and despite being well outside any major town, the restaurant was completely packed. The only open spot was an outdoor table swarmed by wasps. We agreed to take it, but the staff kindly moved us indoors as soon as a table opened up.\n\nThe menu here leaned into that familiar farm-to-table, ingredient-driven fusion style you’d commonly find in bigger cities. The dinner menu looked more inventive and truer to their philosophy, and we wished we had time to stay in the area to try it. The upside of brunch, though, was getting to try a few items from their bakery section.\n\nWe started off with the seared banana bread, and it was the best griddled version I’ve had. Denser and less crumbly than most, with layers of honey, olive oil, salt, and espresso all working together seamlessly.\nNext was the cauliflower agrodolce, which every nearby table seemed to order. The stewed beans in the agrodolce sauce were comforting and familiar, while the fioretto cauliflower (my first time trying it) maintained its crunch even after steaming.\n\nIn the Chicken & Waffle, the waffle was meh but the chicken & slaw were fantastic. They used fennel and ginger aioli to give it a more distinctive aroma, and it really worked well with the chili garlic maple glaze on the chicken.\n\nOn the side, we also tried the cod chowder, a lighter, herbier take on the usual New England style. The broth was clean and brothy, and while the cod itself was a tad rubbery, I liked the refreshing finish. Only thing we didn’t like were the pancakes. Not bad, just plain compared to everything else on the table.\n\nWould definitely come back for dinner next time we’re in the area.",

I was nervous I would be standing in a line for 30min + based on most of the reviews, there is usually a long line to grab a cinnamon roll. I was super lucky walked in around 10:30am on a summer Sunday morning, did not wait at all! I was able to get 2 cinnamon rolls, a classic and a summer special strawberry. They were both delicious! I also had a lavender latte, not a huge fan of it but wanted to try something on their menu.  The cinnamon rolls are very hyped up but in my opinion they are good not anything I would brag about. I know next time if I wanted on I would NOT stand in a line for it. I am glad i decided to try out this spot and the atmosphere is super cut and great place to grab a coffee and sit. I def recommend trying it out if you have not.",
